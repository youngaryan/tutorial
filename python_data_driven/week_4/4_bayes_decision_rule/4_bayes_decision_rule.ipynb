    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* To gain practical experience of Bayesian classification.\n",
    "* To see how a classifier can be evaluated using separate training and test sets.\n",
    "* To compare the performance of 'diagonal covariance’ and 'full covariance’ multivariate Gaussian models.\n",
    "* To learn how to perform 'leave-one-out’ testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have covered the theory of Bayesian classification and we have looked at trivial 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional examples. In this notebook we are going to use the same techniques but apply them to a genuine 13-dimensional classification problem – wine classification!\n",
    "\n",
    "For each section, first read the instructions carefully and make sure that you understand what is being asked before typing any Python code. You will need to make use of the numpy and scipy python libraries (https://www.scipy.org/ and http://www.numpy.org/). If you are not sure how to do something try looking it up in the online documention. If you get stuck then ask a lab demonstrator for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will be using are the genuine results of chemical analyses of wines grown in the same region of Italy but produced from three different varieties of grape. The analyses have determined the quantities of 13 chemical constituents. The task is to use the results of the chemical analyses to identify which of the three grapes was used to produce an unlabeled bottle of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Obtaining the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will form a matrix with 178 rows and 14 columns. Each row is a separate sample (i.e., a different botttle of wine). The first column stores a class label (1, 2 or 3) representing the grape variety. Columns 2 to 14 are the results of the 13 chemical analyses. Note that the features are stored as columns and the samples as rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first load the data into a numpy array using the nump `loadtxt` function that we have seen in previous lab classes."

    "## 4. Notes: Training and evaluating a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a classifier involves two stages. First, the classifier is trained using samples for which we know the correct class labels. Training is the process of estimating the classifier’s parameters, e.g., the means and variances of the data for each class, $\\omega_i$, and the class priors, $P(\\omega_i)$. Once the classifier is trained we can use it to label unknown data. Generally, however, before using the classifier, we first want to evaluate it, i.e., test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *test* the classifier we will use a sample of data that was not seen during training, but for which we know the correct labels. We will classify each of the test samples and compare the classifier’s output to the *known correct* label. We then measure the percentage of the data that has been classified correctly and hope to get as close to 100% as possible. We may also want to look at the samples that are classified incorrectly to see if there is any pattern to the errors (e.g., perhaps two classes are often confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons that will become clearer later in the module, it is very important that the data used for testing the classifier are not the same data that have been used for training it. So we usually start by partitioning our data into  separate (non-overlapping) training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Preparing the wine data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to prepare the data by first separating out the samples for each of the three classes, and then we will divide the data for each class equally between training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find samples belonging to class 1 we need to select the rows of the matrix for which the first column contains a 1. If the data was stored in a numpy 2-D array, `X`, we could select these rows as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "    X[X[:,0]==1,:]\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this idea to separate the data into three numpy 2-D arrays that we will call `wines1`, `wines2` and `wines3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to split `wines1`, `wines2` and `wines3` into equal training and testing partitions. The easiest way is to put the odd rows in the training set and the even rows in the test set. The odd rows of an array `X` can be selected using the syntax 0::2 which iterates from 0 to the last index of a matrix in steps of 2, i.e\n",
    "\n",
    "    X[0::2, :]\n",

    "    \n",
    "Use this idea to make matrices called `wines1_train`, `wines1_test`, `wines2_train` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, combine the test data for each class back into a single test data matrix by stacking the three test data matrices on top of each other. This can be done using numpy's `vstack` function,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    wines_test= np.vstack((wines1_test, wines2_test, wines3_test))\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to use a multivariate Gaussian distribution to represent the distribution of each of the three classes, $p(x|\\omega)$ for $\\omega$ equals 1, 2 or 3. So we need to estimate the mean vector and covariance matrix for each class. In the first instance we are going to assume that the features are uncorrelated. This means that the Gaussian covariance matrix will have 0s for all elements off the diagonal. This is no doubt a poor assumption but in means that our 13 by 13 covariance matrix only contains 13 variances that need estimating rather than 91 parameters (why 91 not 13x13?). Note, diagonal covariance matrices make the probability evaluations very quick to compute and are often used in classification systems, and they can work well even if they do not model the data exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the 13-element mean vector for each class using numpy's `mean` function. Note, you should only use columns 2 to 14 – remember, column 1 stores the class label. (Refer to the previous notebook if you have forgotten how to use `np.mean` to compute the means of each column of a matrix.) Store the results in variables called `mean1`, `mean2` and `mean3`, i.e., a separate mean vector for each class of wine.\n",

We will assume that the prior probabilities are equal, i.e., $P(\\omega_1) = P(\\omega_2) = P(\\omega_3) = \\frac{1}{3}$. We can therefore perform classification simply by comparing $p(x|\\omega_1)$, $p(x|\\omega_2)$ and $p(x|\\omega_3)$.\n",

Also there is not really enough data for accurately evaluating the classifier: just 1 extra error changes the performance evaluation by more than 1%.\n",

But then we repeat the exercise using the 2nd sample for testing and the other $N-1$ for training, and then again using the 3rd sample for testing and so on until we have tested all $N$ samples.
